## Description

This mission is provided by the RadicalX Ai Team, where we have to integrate Gemini into our Python code of Streamlit to create an AI chat interface. Here Gemini is an API, where we need to have Gcloud account to access it.
Moreover, vertexAI is a library that provided us with the Gemini-versions, here we use Gemini-pro in our mission. To complete this mission we have to follow and complete the tasks.
